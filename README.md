# Credit-Score-Classification

A credit score classification project aims to assess individuals' creditworthiness using machine learning techniques. By analyzing factors like income, age, and loan history, the project aims to predict whether individuals are likely to default on loans or exhibit responsible borrowing behavior. Through data preprocessing, feature engineering, and model training, the project aims to develop accurate predictive models. The ultimate goal is to aid financial institutions in making informed lending decisions, mitigating risks, and promoting responsible lending practices.
